This main branch reflects personal work to follow [HWS Project 14](https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/main/SwiftUI/project14) lesson but to apply knowledge to do something slightly different or new. The interface will change as skillsets grow and/or advancing through the lessons and projects.

This map and plotting is a work in progress but aimed to create pre-determined markers on the map, with navlinks with an interface to display location details. See [Issues](https://github.com/matkruse/hws-bucketlist/issues) for current todo list.
